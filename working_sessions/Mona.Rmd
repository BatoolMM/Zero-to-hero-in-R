## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)

```

```{r}
read_csv(here("data","SAFI_clean.csv"))

```

```{r}
interviews <- read_csv(here("data","SAFI_clean.csv"), na = "NULL")


```

```{r}
glimpse(interviews)
wall_type <- interviews$respondent_wall_type
length(unique(wall_type))


```

```{r}
small_data <- interviews %>%
select(village:respondent_wall_type, rooms) %>% 
  filter(village == "God" & rooms > 1)  


```

```{r}
data <- interviews %>% 
  select(affect_conflicts, memb_assoc,liv_count, no_meals) %>% 
  filter(memb_assoc == "yes") 

```

```{r}
small_data <- interviews %>% 
  mutate(people_per_room = round(no_membrs / rooms))

```

```{r}
x <- interviews %>% 
  filter(!is.na(affect_conflicts)) %>% 
  mutate(people_per_room = round(no_membrs / rooms))

```

```{r}
interview_total_meals <- interviews %>% 
  mutate(total_meals = no_membrs * no_meals) %>% 
  filter(total_meals > 20)
```

```{r}
interview_total_meals <- mutate(interviews, total_meals = no_membrs * no_meals)
y  <- filter(interview_total_meals, total_meals > 20)


```

```{r}
grouped <- interviews %>% 
  group_by(village) %>% 
  summarise(mean = mean(no_membrs), max(no_membrs)) %>% 
  ungroup()
```
